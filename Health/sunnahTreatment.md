# Introduction

> The Prophet saw said, "There is no disease that Allah has created, except that He also has created its treatment."  Sahih Al Bukhari Volume 7, Book 71, Number 582     

This is not an alternative to Medical Treatment or replacement of Educated Professional Medical Doctor. 
These are some alternatives to follow with medical treatments. (In some case if medical treatment fails or with medical treatment.)

It is Sunnah to consult Professional Educated Doctor in case of medicle need.
