> 16. (Luqman said): “Son, Allah will bring forth everything even if it be as small as the grain of a mustard seed even though it be hidden inside a rock or (anywhere) in the heavens or earth. Allah is Most Subtle, All-Aware. (
> 17. Son, establish Prayer, enjoin all that is good and forbid all that is evil, and endure with patience whatever affliction befalls you. Surely these have been emphatically enjoined. 
> 18. Do not (contemptuously) turn your face away from people, nor tread haughtily upon earth. Allah does not love the arrogant and the vainglorious. (18) Be moderate in your stride and lower your voice. Verily the most disgusting of all voices is the braying of the donkey.”

## Gluttony
1. Al-Hasan reported: Umar ibn al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, saw a man with a large belly and he said, "What is this?" The man said, "It is a blessing from Allah.” Umar said, “No, rather it is a punishment." ~ [Ḥadīth Muḥammad ibn ‘Abd Allāh al-Anṣārī 42](https://www.abuaminaelias.com/dailyhadithonline/2018/03/04/big-belly-punishment-not-blessing/)
