This is not an alternative to Medical Treatment or replacement of Doctors. 
These are some alternatives to follow with medicle treatments. (In some case if medicle treatment fails or with medicle treatment.) 
I mean Allopathy, Homeopathy or any other modern medicle treatment and medicine by the word Medicle treatment.
It is Sunnah to consult Professional Educated Doctor in case of medicle need.
